# Weapons

## Review
Zach Cregger’s follow-up leans into dread over jump scares, unfolding as a chaptered mystery in a quiet Midwestern town after a mass disappearance of children. Each segment shifts to a new point of view—an overwhelmed teacher, a grieving parent, a compromised cop—slowly tightening the noose around an explanation that’s more unsettling than supernatural fireworks. The film’s power comes from mood and implication: empty cul-de-sacs, humming streetlights, and the sense that ordinary places can’t protect anyone.

## Highlights
- Chapter-based structure that reveals the puzzle piece by piece  
- Suburban spaces staged for slow-burn tension and unease  
- Performances that keep the horror human and grounded  

## Weak Points
- A saggy middle where momentum trades places with ambiguity  
- The finale’s interpretation-heavy answers may divide audiences  

## Verdict
A chilling, confidently constructed mystery that favors atmosphere and implication over spectacle—creepy in the best way.
