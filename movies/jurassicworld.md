# Jurassic World: Rebirth

## Review
This chapter resets the series with a lean survival adventure. Dinosaurs now thrive only in equatorial pockets, and a pharma-backed expedition heads into one of the last wild zones to secure samples that could power a lifesaving treatment. The setup keeps the stakes human—extraction meets rescue—while the jungle setting and on-location photography give the chases texture. It aims for a mix of throwback awe and creature-feature danger rather than nonstop CG overload.

## Highlights
- A focused, **mission-gone-sideways** plot that blends science quest and rescue thriller  
- Emphasis on **real locations and practical spectacle**, which sells scale and danger  
- Clean, readable set pieces that stage dinosaurs as **apex threats** rather than background noise  

## Weak Points
- Character arcs can feel thin next to the logistics of the mission  
- The third act leans on familiar franchise beats  
- Some exposition about the equatorial zones slows momentum

## Verdict
A solid course correction: more tension and terrain, less theme-park gloss. It doesn’t reinvent the series, but it delivers a grounded, crowd-pleasing dino adventure.
