# Superman

## Review
This take leans into optimism and identity. Clark’s journey balances small-town warmth with citywide stakes, and the film remembers that Superman saves people first and fights second. The tone is bright without feeling naive, and the action reads cleanly.

## Highlights
- A sincere, hopeful tone that still finds real tension  
- Strong chemistry between Clark and Lois  
- Airborne set pieces that stay readable and thrilling

## Weak Points
- A busy middle act that juggles too many threads  
- The villain’s plan feels thin once examined

## Verdict
A confident reset that puts character and clarity up front. It flies.
