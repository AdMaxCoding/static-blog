# Deadpool & Wolverine

## Review
The movie is loud and busy, with gags landing often but rarely building to anything meaningful. The chemistry between the leads is there, yet the script keeps undercutting emotional beats with punchlines. Action scenes start strong, then give way to CG clutter and quick cuts. It plays like a highlight reel of references rather than a story that earns its moments.

## Highlights
- The two leads bounce off each other well  
- A few inventive R-rated fights and practical gags  
- Some fourth wall jokes genuinely hit

## Weak Points
- Plot feels stitched together from cameos and multiverse setups  
- Tonal whiplash: every serious moment gets deflated by a joke  
- CG-heavy sequences blur otherwise solid stunt work  
- Third act drags and resets the stakes

## Verdict
There are laughs and a couple of solid set pieces, but the constant winking and reference chasing drown out character and momentum.
