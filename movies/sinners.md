# Sinners

## Review
A mood piece with teeth. It blends folklore with moral rot, staging dread like a slow blues riff that keeps tightening. Performances simmer, and the soundscape lingers long after.

## Highlights
- Thick atmosphere and striking, deliberate imagery  
- Standout lead performance with real vulnerability  
- Music and sound design that carry story and theme

## Weak Points
- A meditative second act that some will find slow  
- An ending that invites debate more than closure

## Verdict
Audacious and confidently crafted. One for the yearâ€™s best lists.
