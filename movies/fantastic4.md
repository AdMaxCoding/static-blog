# The Fantastic Four: First Steps

## Review
This is a family story disguised as a science adventure. The film favors discovery over destruction, with clever uses of each power and a retro-futurist look that gives it personality.

## Highlights
- Ensemble chemistry that feels like a real family  
- Imaginative science problems and solutions  
- Distinct production design that stands out in the genre

## Weak Points
- Setup heavy first act slows momentum  
- Antagonist motivations could use more shading

## Verdict
Not the loudest Marvel outing, but one of the more charming and inventive.
